## What is an ethical approval?

An ethical review and approval is a peer-review process to help researchers fulfil their personal responsibility to act in accordance with the [Netherlands code of conduct for research integrity (NCCRI)](https://www.nwo.nl/en/netherlands-code-conduct-research-integrity) and fully account for ethical issues related to research involving humans. This minimises risk to the project, the researcher, the participants, and the University.

Failure to obtain and adhere to ethical approvals is defined as research misconduct.

Adhering to the requirements of NCCRI, ERIM has set up [internal review boards (IRBs)](https://www.erim.eur.nl/research-integrity/irb/). Each of the two schools belonging to ERIM host their own internal review board. The [RSM board](https://www.erim.eur.nl/research-integrity/irb/rsm-internal-review-boards/) and [ESE board](https://www.erim.eur.nl/research-integrity/irb/ese-internal-review-boards/) somewhat differ slighlty in their guidelines and practices, which you will find on the relevant page.

## Ethical dilemmas

How to deal with ethical dilemmas is not a simple task,that is why EUR developed a game called [the dilemma game app](https://www.eur.nl/en/about-eur/policy-and-regulations/integrity/research-integrity/dilemma-game), where you can find examples of real ethical dilemmas that reseachers, students, research support staff, etc. have experienced.
